      <h2>Abstract</h2>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">
Agentic artificial intelligence refers to systems capable of autonomous, goal-directed behavior and structured reasoning. It is emerging as a transformative paradigm for medical image analysis and clinical workflows. Unlike conventional predictive models that function in a passive, task-specific manner, agentic AI can actively interact with imaging platforms, access and integrate external knowledge sources, iteratively refine analytical outputs, and recommend context-aware actions to support diagnostic or interventional decision-making. Nevertheless, the deployment of such systems in high-stakes clinical environments introduces significant challenges, including maintaining robust perception under distributional shifts, ensuring adherence to physical and physiological constraints, providing transparent and interpretable multi-step reasoning processes, and aligning system behavior with established clinical guidelines, regulatory standards, and patient safety requirements.

This workshop focuses on machine learning methodologies that enable the design, training, and evaluation of agentic AI systems for medical imaging and broader clinical applications. We highlight approaches that integrate perception, reasoning, and decision-making into unified frameworks, including vision–language models for radiology report generation, reinforcement learning for adaptive imaging protocols, and AI agents that collaborate with human clinicians via interactive interfaces. Topics of interest include multi-modal representation learning, tool-augmented large language models, memory-augmented architectures, self-supervised pretraining on hospital data streams, and uncertainty-aware planning under partial observability.

A central theme of this research topic is the human–AI partnership. We explore how agentic systems can be designed to explain their actions, respect clinical workflows, and defer appropriately to human expertise. Particular attention is given to evaluation methodologies that go beyond task-specific accuracy to measure safety, trustworthiness, and clinical utility in realistic simulation environments and prospective studies.

By bringing together researchers from machine learning, computer vision, clinical informatics, radiology, and interventional medicine, this workshop aims to catalyze the development of next-generation AI systems that do not merely detect abnormalities, but actively assist, reason, and adapt alongside medical professionals in the pursuit of better patient outcomes.      </p>

      <h2>Workshop Topics</h2>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">
        This half-day workshop focuses on machine learning methodologies that enable the design, development, and deployment of agentic AI systems for clinical decision-making, with a particular emphasis on medical imaging and associated workflows. While grounded in the concrete challenges of radiology, pathology, and interventional medicine, where decisions are time-critical, multi-modal, and tightly bound to patient safety, the workshop highlights a broader vision of \textbf{Agentic Clinical AI}: systems that not only perceive and predict, but also reason, act, and adapt in collaboration with human clinicians.

We aim to bring together researchers from machine learning, computer vision, biomedical informatics, clinical AI, and regulatory science to explore how autonomous agents can move beyond static prediction toward dynamic, goal-driven behavior in clinical environments. This is why we belive that ECML-PKDD is a perfect venue to host this workshop. A central objective is to foster cross-pollination between medical imaging, natural language processing, reinforcement learning, and human–computer interaction, as agentic systems inherently require integration across these disciplines. Key themes include interactive vision–language models for report generation and decision support, reinforcement learning for adaptive imaging protocols and treatment planning, and tool-augmented agents that query electronic health records, literature, or imaging databases in real time. Equally important are the challenges of safety, interpretability, and human alignment: how can we design agents that explain their reasoning, respect clinical workflows, and know when to defer to human expertise?

By emphasizing learning paradigms that enable robust performance under distribution shift, sparse feedback, and high-stakes uncertainty, the workshop aims to accelerate the translation of agentic AI from research prototypes to clinically validated systems that meaningfully augment diagnostic accuracy, operational efficiency, and patient care.

We invite contributions that introduce novel problem formulations, propose innovative agent architectures, or report on empirical studies of agentic systems deployed in simulated or real clinical environments. Submissions that highlight interdisciplinary collaboration, human-in-the-loop design, rigorous evaluation protocols, or explainability and trustworthiness in medical agents are particularly encouraged.
